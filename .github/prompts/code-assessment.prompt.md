# Code Assessment Task

Perform a comprehensive assessment of the codebase to identify components requiring attention for upgrading, refactoring, security improvements, or cloud migration readiness.

## Context
- **Read all copilot-instructions files** (`.github/copilot-instructions*.md`) to understand:
  - Project architecture and conventions
  - Language and framework-specific patterns
  - Build tools and testing strategies
  - Code quality standards
- Apply language-specific assessment criteria based on those instructions

## Assessment Areas

### 1. Dependency Analysis
- Review dependency manifests for:
  - Outdated dependencies (check for newer stable versions)
  - Security vulnerabilities (CVEs)
  - Pre-release/beta versions vs stable
  - Consistency across multiple build systems (if applicable)
- Run dependency analysis commands appropriate for the project

### 2. Code Quality & Architecture
- Adherence to project-specific patterns (from copilot-instructions)
- Proper use of framework conventions
- Separation of concerns
- Package/module organization
- Code style and formatting compliance

### 3. Testing Coverage
- Unit test coverage and quality
- Integration test patterns
- Test configuration and setup
- Use of appropriate testing frameworks and assertion libraries

### 4. Cloud Readiness
- Configuration externalization (no hardcoded values)
- Database connection patterns (cloud service compatibility)
- Logging and monitoring readiness
- Secrets management (no hardcoded credentials)
- Container readiness (containerization approach)
- Scalability considerations

### 5. Security Assessment
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Input validation coverage
- Injection protection (SQL, command, etc.)
- Secure communication enforcement
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Secrets exposure risks

### 6. Build & CI/CD
- Build tool configuration quality
- Test execution strategy
- Code quality enforcement (linting, formatting)
- Static analysis tools configuration
- Deployment manifests quality (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

## Output Requirements

Create `docs/initial-code-assessment.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Code Assessment Report

**Assessment Date:** [Date]
**Assessed By:** GitHub Copilot Agent

## Executive Summary
- Overall health score/status
- Critical issues count
- Key recommendations (top 3-5)

## 1. Dependency Analysis
### Current Technology Stack
- Framework/platform versions
- Language version
- Key dependencies

### Issues Identified
- **[Severity]** Issue description
  - **Impact:** [description]
  - **Recommendation:** [action]
  - **Effort:** [Small/Medium/Large]

## 2. Code Quality Findings
### Strengths
### Areas for Improvement

## 3. Testing Assessment
### Coverage Analysis
### Test Quality

## 4. Cloud Readiness
### Current State
### Migration Readiness Issues

## 5. Security Analysis
### Vulnerabilities Found
### Best Practice Gaps

## 6. Build & CI/CD
### Build Configuration
### Quality Gates

## Prioritized Action Items
1. **[Critical]** [Issue] - [Effort estimate]
2. **[High]** [Issue] - [Effort estimate]
...

## Recommended Next Steps
- **Immediate actions** (< 1 week)
- **Short-term improvements** (1-4 weeks)
- **Long-term enhancements** (> 1 month)
```

## Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, broken builds, data loss risks
- **High**: Performance issues, deprecated APIs, major technical debt
- **Medium**: Code quality improvements, minor refactoring needs
- **Low**: Style inconsistencies, documentation gaps

## Assessment Process
1. Read copilot-instructions files to understand project specifics
2. Run build and test commands (as defined in instructions)
3. Analyze dependency manifests
4. Review code organization and patterns
5. Check for security issues
6. Evaluate cloud readiness
7. Document findings with severity and effort estimates

## Next Action
After completing the assessment and creating `docs/initial-code-assessment.md`:
1. **Review critical and high-severity issues** with the user
2. **For each critical issue**, execute `/create-goal-plan` to create a structured implementation plan
3. Create separate goal plans for:
   - Critical security vulnerabilities
   - Critical technical debt
   - High-priority refactoring needs
4. Ensure each plan has clear acceptance criteria tied to the assessment findings
