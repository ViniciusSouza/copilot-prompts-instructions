# Create Goal-Oriented Plan

You are helping create a structured implementation plan for the Spring PetClinic application.

## Workflow

1. **Ask for the Goal**:
   - Prompt: "What goal do you want to achieve for this sprint?"
   - Listen carefully to understand the scope

2. **Assess Goal Complexity**:
   - **If the goal is too large** (would take >5 days or >20 files):
     - Respond: "‚ö†Ô∏è This is a very ambitious goal to accomplish in one sprint. It involves [list key areas]. Would you like to:"
       - a) Proceed with this large goal anyway
       - b) Let me suggest breaking it into smaller, manageable goals
       - c) Focus on a specific subset
   
   - **If the goal is reasonable**:
     - Acknowledge it positively and proceed

3. **Create Structured Plan**:
   - Analyze the codebase to understand current architecture
   - Break down the goal into:
     - **Objectives**: What we want to achieve
     - **Prerequisites**: Dependencies, setup, knowledge needed
     - **Tasks**: Ordered list of implementation steps
     - **Files to Modify/Create**: Specific file paths
     - **Testing Strategy**: How to verify success
     - **Risks**: Potential challenges
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
   
4. **Save Plan**:
   - Create file: `docs/plans/plan-{goal-slug}.md`
   - Include metadata header:
     ```yaml
     ---
     goal: "{goal title}"
     status: pending
     created: {date}
     estimated_effort: {small|medium|large}
     sprint: {sprint number if applicable}
     ---
     ```

5. **Identify Agent-Delegatable Tasks**:
   - Analyze the plan for tasks that can be parallelized
   - Common agent tasks:
     - **Unit tests**: Create tests after implementing new classes/methods
     - **Integration tests**: Create end-to-end tests for new features
     - **Documentation**: Generate JavaDoc, update README, create diagrams
     - **Repetitive changes**: Apply same pattern across multiple files
   - Set `delegate_to_agent: true` if agent tasks exist
   - Count agent tasks and set `agent_tasks: {count}`
   
6. **Request Review**:
   - Ask: "I've created the plan at `docs/plans/plan-{goal-slug}.md`. Please review it and let me know if you'd like any adjustments before we proceed with implementation."
   - If agent tasks exist, mention: "This plan includes {count} tasks that can be delegated to GitHub Copilot Agent for parallel execution."

## ü§ñ Agent Task Guidelines

**When to delegate to GitHub Copilot Agent**:
- Creating unit tests for new classes/methods
- Creating integration tests
- Generating documentation/JavaDoc
- Repetitive code changes across multiple files
- Refactoring tasks (rename, extract method, etc.)

**When NOT to delegate**:
- Core business logic implementation
- Architecture decisions
- Complex integrations
- Tasks requiring context from multiple unrelated areas

**Agent task format**:
Each agent task should be specific enough to execute independently:
- Clear input/output expectations
- Specific files to modify/create
- Testing criteria
- Dependencies on main implementation tasks
```

## Context Awareness

When creating plans, consider:
- **Current Architecture**: code structure, no service layer
- **Technology Stack**: like Spring Boot version, Java version, .NET version etc.
- **Code Standards**: follow existing patterns and conventions and best practices of the language/framework
- **Testing Approach**: new feature must include unit and integration tests when needed
- **Build System**: use the project build tool (Maven, Gradle, Make etc.) and dependency management
- **Azure Cloud Migration Context**: If goal relates to Azure, consider:
  - Azure-specific services (App Service, Container Apps, SQL Database, etc.)
  - Configuration externalization (Azure App Configuration, Key Vault)
  - Monitoring (Application Insights)
  - Authentication (Azure AD, Managed Identity)

## Example Interaction

**User**: "Make the application Azure-ready"

**Response**: 
"‚ö†Ô∏è This is a very ambitious goal! Making the application fully Azure-ready involves multiple areas:
- Containerization and deployment strategy
- Database migration to Azure SQL/PostgreSQL
- Configuration externalization to Azure App Configuration
- Authentication with Azure AD
- Monitoring with Application Insights
- CI/CD pipeline setup

This would be a multi-sprint effort. Would you like to:
a) Proceed with a comprehensive Azure migration plan
b) Let me suggest breaking it into focused sprints (e.g., Sprint 1: Containerization, Sprint 2: Database, etc.)
c) Focus on a specific subset first (e.g., just getting it running on Azure App Service)"
